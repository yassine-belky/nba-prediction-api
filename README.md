# nba-prediction-api
This project provides an API for predicting the likelihood of NBA players staying in the league for five years based on their performance statistics. 

It utilizes a simple machine learning model trained on historical player data. 

The API allows users to make predictions by sending requests with relevant player statistics and receiving predictions as responses. 

Additionally, the repository should include a Streamlit frontend for interactively exploring the predictions.
